#Natural Words

Natural words is a simple calculator that takes a single word as the input and outputs the root or soul number 
residing inside of the word.
Natural addition is the act of taking a number and adding all the seperate intergers inside the number together
until there is only a single digit. This is what is called the "root" or "soul" number.
Each number 1-9 and 10-52 just about all have there own unique meanings. This tool allows avid users of this 
numerology to have all this information in the palm of their hand.

We based this program off of the practices of the Chaldean and their use of numerology found inside "Cheiro's Book of 
Numbers".
